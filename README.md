## Mini Aspire Loan App

A Laravel app that helps user to apply for loan for a specific term period and then repay the part of amount every week once admin approves the loan application.

The task is defined below:

- Build a simple API that allows to handle user loans
- Necessary entities will have to be : users, loans and repayments.
- The API should allow simple use cases, which include creating a new user, creating a new loan for a user with different attributes (e.g. principal, repayment frequency), and allowing a user to make repayments for the loan.
- The app logic should figure out and not allow obvious errors. For example a user cannot make a repayment for a loan thatâ€™s already been repaid.
